The future big data analytics for communication
service providers will most certainly shift towards realtime
analytics and process automation. It will be crucial to
react as soon as possible and the reaction time will
differentiate CSPs how they understand their customers
and how they react on their customer needs and problems

The more
logical approach is to design 5G to be fully self-organizing with
end-to-end network behavior intelligence, from the perspective
of a self-organizing network (SON) engine, so that it can
exploit the cognition of the context of application as well as
that of the state of the network to divert and focus the right
amount of network resources when and where needed such
that users will perceive seamless and limitless connectivity.

40-50x gain but with big complexity increase
5G node has about 5000 parameters to optimize

SON must increase to enable 5G
-Self optimization and self healing properties
-must be more self aware
-from reactive to proactive in 5G
